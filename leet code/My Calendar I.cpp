You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), 
the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. 
Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

class MyCalendar {
public:
    
    vector<pair<int,int>> cal;
    
    MyCalendar() {
        
    }
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        for(int i = 0; i < cal.size();i++){
            if((cal[i].first <= start && cal[i].second > start) || (cal[i].first < end && cal[i].second > end) || ((cal[i].first > start && cal[i].second <= end))){        
                return false;
            }
        }
        cal.push_back({start,end});
        return true;
    }
};

/**
 * Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyCalendar* obj = new MyCalendar();
 * bool param_1 = obj->book(start,end);

    ***********************************************************


There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. 
You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. 
More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. 
The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B 
such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

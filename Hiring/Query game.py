**********************************************************************************************


You are also given Q queries of the form: 


	1 0 0: Reverse the array A
	2 i j: Swap the elements A[i] and A[j]
	3 x 0:  Print the position of element x in array A


Task

Print the position of x in array A after each query of type 3.

Note: 1-based indexing is followed.

Example 

Assumptions


	N = 4
	A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
	Q = 4
	Queries = [[ 2 2 4 ], [ 3 2 0 ], [ 1 0 0 ], [ 3 1 0 ]]


Approach


	The first query is of type 2, and i and j are 2 and 4 respectively. So you swap A[2], A[4]. Array A becomes [1, 4, 3, 2].
	The second query is of type 3, and x is 2. So you need to output index of 2 in array A, so the output is 4.
	The third query is of type 1. So you reverse array A. A= [2, 3, 4, 1].
	The last query is of type 3, and x is  1.  So you need to output index of 1 in array A, so the output is 4.


Hence, the answer is [4 4].

Function description:

Complete the function query_game provided in the editor. This function takes the following 4 parameters and returns the required answer:


	N: Represents the size of array A
	A: Represents the elements of array A
	Q: Represent the number of queries
	P: Represents the queries in form of 2D array with Q rows and 3 columns


Input format:

Note: This is the input format that you must use to provide custom input (available above the Compile and Test button).


	The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. T also specifies the number of times you have to run the query_game function on a different set of inputs.
	For each test case:
	
		The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A.
		The second line contains N space-separated values, denoting the elements of A.
		The third line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries. 
		Q lines follow, each containing queries in the form of 3 space-separated integers.
	
	


Output format:

For each test case in a new line, print the index of x in array A for each query of type 3 in space-separated format.

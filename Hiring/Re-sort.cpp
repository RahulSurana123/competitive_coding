Re-sort
You are given a permutation A of 1 to N with only even lengthed slopes. A slope is defined as a consecutively decreasing subarray.

Note: A subarray containing a single element is also considered a slope of length 1. For example, the sequence [5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 3] has 2 slopes of length 2, i.e., [5, 1] and [6, 2], and 2 slopes of length 1, i.e., [4] and [3].

Consider the following algorithm to sort the permutation:

re-sort(sequence A):
    while(A is not sorted in non decreasing order):
        partition A into minimum number of consecutive slopes
        for each slope with length > 1:
            reverse(slope)
Task

Determine the total number of times reverse() is called when the sequence A is passed to re-sort()

Note: An array b is a subarray of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero, or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero, or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.

Example

Assumptions

N = 2
A = [2, 1]
Approach

The given sequence has only 1 slope initially of length 2.
When it is passed to re-sort(), the slope [2, 1] is reversed.
Now the sequence becomes [1, 2].
Hence, the output is 1 as reverse() is called only 1 time.

Function description

Complete the reverseCount function provided in the editor. This function takes the following 2 parameters and returns the number of times reverse function would be called in re-sort():

N: Represents an integer denoting the length of the permutation
A: Represents an array of integers denoting the permutation

Input format:

Note: This is the input format that you must use to provide custom input (available above the Compile and Test button).

The first line contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. T also denotes the number of times you have to run the reverseCount function on a different set of inputs.
For each test case:
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the length of the permutation.
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the permutation.

Output format:

For each test case, print only one integer in a single line representing the number of times reverse() is called.
